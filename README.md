# README.google_play_store
# To upload you flutter app on the google play console:-
1. You need to make changes in the project to make a release build
   In android/app/build.gradle file add this code :-
   ''' signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile = keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword = keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            // signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug
            //for release use this code...
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true // Enable ProGuard for release build
            shrinkResources true // Reduce resource size
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }'''

  This will make the app run in release mode.

2. Now create a .aab bundle file to release on google play store
   ''' flutter build appbundle --release '''
